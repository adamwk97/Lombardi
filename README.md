In this presentation we introduce the work of Mark Lombardi's hand drawn graph networks and implement them using R. Mark Lombardi was a neo-conceptual artist who based his drawings off of his personal conspiracy theories involving allaged financial and political frauds and general abuse of power among power brokers. This R package, 'Lombardi', will implement and utilize different functions within R and CRAN, notably 'tm' and iGraph, in order to accurately recreate these networks through scraping, cleaning and graphing data. This project is a work in progress.
