In this R Lombardi R package we introduce the work of Mark Lombardi's hand drawing and network graphs using R. Mark Lombardi was a neo-conceptual artist who based his drawings off of his personal conspiracy theories involving alleged financial and political frauds. This package re-introduces the 'union' function together with different packages ('tm' and iGraph) to create Lombardi's networks through poly-arc. Part of this package contains code for scraping and cleaning data to generate Lombardi network graph.
